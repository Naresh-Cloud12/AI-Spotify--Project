# AI-Spotify--Project Hi

Spotify Project

What You Can Say to Explain the Project
"In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the genre of a song based on audio features from Spotify such as tempo, loudness, danceability, valence, and more.

I used classification algorithms — K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. I preprocessed the data by removing irrelevant columns, encoding genre labels, and scaling the features.

After training the models, I found that Random Forest performed the best with ~88% accuracy. I also used a confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate performance in more detail."

 What was the goal of this project?
✅ Tip: Mention:

Predicting genre from audio features

It’s a multi-class classification problem

Why did you drop some columns?
✅ Tip:
Columns like track_name, playlist_id, and artist_name don’t help in prediction — they are text identifiers, not numerical features.

Why did you use LabelEncoder?
✅ Tip:
Because playlist_genre is categorical (text). Models only understand numerical values, so LabelEncoder was used to convert "pop" → 0, "rock" → 1, etc.

🔸 4. Why did you scale the data?
✅ Tip:
Feature ranges vary (e.g., tempo vs loudness). Scaling ensures that all features are treated equally by the model and helps it converge faster.

🔸 5. Which algorithm performed best? Why?
✅ Tip:
Random Forest gave the best accuracy because it is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

🔸 6. What is a confusion matrix?
✅ Tip:
A confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each genre. It helps understand where the model is confused (e.g., hip hop misclassified as r&b).

🔸 7. What is the meaning of precision, recall, and f1-score?
✅ Tip:

Precision: Correct positive predictions out of total predicted positive

Recall: Correct positive predictions out of actual positives

F1-score: Balance between precision and recall

🔸 8. How would you improve this model further?
✅ Tip: You can say:

Try other models like SVM or Gradient Boosting

Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

Add more audio features

Use deep learning (if larger dataset)

🔸 9. Where would you use this in real life?
✅ Tip:

Spotify recommendations

Playlist auto-tagging

Music streaming personalization

🔸 10. Can you deploy this model?
✅ Tip:
Yes, with tools like:

Flask / FastAPI (for web API)

Streamlit (for UI)

Save model using joblib or pickle

Host on AWS, GCP, or Heroku
